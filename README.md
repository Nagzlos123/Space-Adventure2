# Space-Adventure2

A computer game application with the ability to switch between five equipment systems was designed to test them. The main part of the application was made using the Unity engine. Visual Studio 2019 and the C# language were used to write the appropriate software. A user interface ergonomic evaluation checklist based on the Ravden-Johnson checklist was used to evaluate the individual equipment systems.
